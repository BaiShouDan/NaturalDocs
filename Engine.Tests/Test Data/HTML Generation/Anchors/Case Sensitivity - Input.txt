
Title: Case Insensitivity
_______________________________________________________________________________

Whenever the algorithm changes the output HTML needs to be tested in every browser.  Every topic 
has a long body so that you can easily check if the browser correctly navigates to it.


	Case Sensitive Anchors:

		Internet Explorer cannot handle case sensitive anchors, meaning it won't distinguish between
		#member and #Member.  This is annoying because it means URLs will be uglier when you have
		two anchors that differ only in case, such as for a private variable and it's public property.  Alas.

		It's been changed, but this is left here for reference.

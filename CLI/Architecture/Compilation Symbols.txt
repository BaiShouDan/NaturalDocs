	SHOW_EXECUTION_TIME - If defined, shows the number of ticks the program has run for.  This surrounds <Main()>
														 so it does not include the time it takes Windows and .NET to load the program, nor does
														 it include any static variable initialization.  It does however include <Engine.Instance's>
														 initialization and all processing done within it.

	PAUSE_ON_ERROR - If defined, the console will require a key press before exiting when an error occurs.  This is
											mainly used when running it from Visual Studio and you don't want the console window to
											disappear.

	PAUSE_BEFORE_EXIT - If defined, the console will require a key press before exiting, regardless of whether an
												 error has occurred or not.  This is mainly used when running it from Visual Studio and you
												 don't want the console window to disappear.

	Macro: WORK_ON_MAIN_THREAD
	
		If defined, the CLI will do processing in the main thread instead of spawning worker threads.  May make
		debugging easier.  Additional threads will still be created for things like status updates.
		
		This also has the effect of only using a single core for processing.

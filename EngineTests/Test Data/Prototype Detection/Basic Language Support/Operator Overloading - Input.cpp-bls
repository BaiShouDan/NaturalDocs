
Some languages allow operator overloading.  We do not want < or << to be detected as an opening bracket
as that would prevent the prototype enders from being detected in these cases.

--- Test Data

/* Function: operator<
*/
int operator< (LineIterator a, LineIterator b)
	{
	}

/* Function: operator<<
*/
LineIterator operator<< (LineIterator input)
	{

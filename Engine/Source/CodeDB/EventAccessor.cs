 * Class: GregValure.NaturalDocs.Engine.CodeDB.EventAccessor
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 * 
 * A variation of <Accessor> that is passed along with change events.  This is necessary because the code
 * handling the events may need to query the database for more information, and this exposes only the small
 * subset of functions that should be allowed then.  Also, since there may be multiple build targets querying
 * for the same information, this caches certain results so they don't have to be retrieved from the database
 * every time.

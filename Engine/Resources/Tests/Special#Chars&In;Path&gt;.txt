
Title: Special#Chars&In;Path&gt;
_______________________________________________________________________________

	All the above symbols should be stripped out of the URL and output file path.  See
	<GregValure.NaturalDocs.Engine.Output.Builders.HTML.Path Restrictions> for the rationale.  However,
	all of these characters should still appear in the menu and page title.

	There should be an ampersand in between Chars and In.  However, at the end of the name should be
	&gt; and not the symbol >.  This makes sure characters are being escaped correctly as well.

_______________________________________________________________________________


Macros: SQLite Character Mode

	Determines which mode SQLite will be run in.  One of these must be defined.

	SQLITE_UTF16 - Use SQLite in UTF-16 mode.
	SQLITE_UTF8 - Use SQLite in UTF-8 mode.

	Running in UTF-8 mode means a smaller database file, which means less disk access and less memory use.  It also 
	means more of the database can stay in the memory it does use.  However, it also means strings have to be constantly 
	converted between C#'s native UTF-16 strings and SQLite's UTF-8 ones.  Having these symbols available lets you
	easily test the performance tradeoff.
	
	Note, however, that this only applies to new databases.  When testing, you must delete CodeDB.nd for it to really take
	effect.
	
	
Macros: Other Symbols

	DONT_SHRINK_FILES - If defined, extra whitespace and comments will not be removed from JS, JSON, and CSS files.

	SHOW_NDMARKUP - If defined, Natural Docs will put a copy of the <NDMarkup> in the output.

	SHOW_FILE_PARSING - If defined, Natural Docs will include a console message for every file parsed.  Useful for figuring
									out which file is causing a crash.  You should use --worker-threads 1 as well or else the status
									messages from different threads will get mixed together.

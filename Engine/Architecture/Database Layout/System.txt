
Database Table: CodeDB.System
_______________________________________________________________________________

A simple, one-row table that stores various information about the database.


Column: Version
	
	(SQL Prototype)
		Version TEXT NOT NULL
	(end)
	
	The version string of the database.  This will always be present no matter what version of Natural Docs is being used,
	so you can safely do "SELECT Version from System" on any past or future version of Natural Docs based on SQLite.
	
	
Column: UsedTopicIDs

	(SQL Prototype)
		UsedTopicIDs TEXT NOT NULL
	(end)

	A string containing the <Engine.IDObjects.NumberSet> for all the used topic IDs in <CodeDB.Topics>.  This is only used 
	for storage between Natural Docs executions.  It is not continually updated during execution.
	
	
Column: UsedLinkIDs

	(SQL Prototype)
		UsedLinkIDs TEXT NOT NULL
	(end)

	A string containing the <Engine.IDObjects.NumberSet> for all the used link IDs in <CodeDB.Topics>.  This is only used 
	for storage between Natural Docs executions.  It is not continually updated during execution.
	
	
Column: UsedContextIDs

	(SQL Prototype)
		UsedContextIDs TEXT NOT NULL
	(end)

	A string containing the <Engine.IDObjects.NumberSet> for all the used context IDs in <CodeDB.Contexts>.  This is only
	used for storage between Natural Docs executions.  It is not continually updated during execution.

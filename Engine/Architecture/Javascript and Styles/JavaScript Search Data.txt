
Title: JavaScript Search Data
_______________________________________________________________________________

	Because Natural Docs' output needs to be able to function as just static HTML files on a local hard drive, it can't rely on a 
	database to generate search results live.  Instead it pregenerates results and saves them as JavaScript files located in the 
	search subfolder of the output folder.  These files are not linked to the HTML by default so any Javascript that needs them 
	is responsible for loading them.  If you include the DefaultJS style this will be handled by <NDSearch>.


	Topic: Keyword Segmenting

		Results are grouped by keyword, and then grouped into data files by the keywords' first three lowercase characters.  The 
		file names use UTF-16 characters encoded in lowercase hex:
		
		> [Output Folder]\search\keywords\[hex char 1][hex char 2][hex char 3].js
		
		So the output file for "and" would be:

		> [Output Folder]\search\keywords\0061006e0064.js
		
		However, keywords that are only one or two characters long have their own file.  So the file for "app" will store both Apple 
		and Application, but the file for "a" will only store keywords that are exactly "a" and not include keywords that start with A.


	Topic: Keyword Segment File

		The keyword segment file calls <NDSearch.OnKeywordSegmentLoaded()> with its data, which conceptually looks like this:

		> NDSearch.OnKeywordSegmentLoaded(keywordSegmentID, keywords[]);
		>
		> keyword: [ htmlName, searchText (optional), members[] ]
		>  - searchText is undefined if it's the same as htmlName in lowercase
		>
		> member: [ htmlQualifier (optional), htmlName (optional), searchText (optional), fileHashPath, classHashPath (optional) ]
		>  - htmlQualifier is undefined if there isn't one
		>  - htmlName is undefined if it's the same as the keyword's htmlName
		>  - searchText is undefined if it's the same as htmlName in lowercase
		>  - classHashPath is undefined if there isn't one

		Applied without removing optional parameters it would look like this:

		> NDSearch.OnKeywordSegmentLoaded(
		>    "acc", [
		>       [ "Accessor", "accessor", [
		>          [ undefined, "Accessor", "accessor", "File:Folder/Documentation.txt:Accessor", undefined ]
		>          [ "ClassA.", "Accessor", "accessor", "File:Folder/ClassA.cs:ClassA.Accessor", "CSharpClass:ClassA:Accessor" ],
		>          [ "ClassB::", "Accessor", "accessor", "File:Folder/ClassB.cpp:ClassB.Accessor", "CClass:ClassB:Accessor" ]
		>       ]]
		>    ]);

		With optional parameters applied it looks like this:

		> NDSearch.OnKeywordSegmentLoaded(
		>    "acc", [
		>       [ "Accessor", , [
		>          [ , , , "File:Folder/Documentation.txt#Accessor" ]
		>          [ "ClassA.", , , "File:Folder/ClassA.cs:ClassA.Accessor", "CSharpClass:ClassA:Accessor" ],
		>          [ "ClassB::", , , "File:Folder/ClassB.cpp:ClassB.Accessor", "CClass:ClassB:Accessor" ]
		>       ]]
		>    ]);

		The use of optional parameters greatly cuts down on redundant data to limit file sizes.  They only appear when necessary.
		For example, the keyword "operator<" would need htmlName "operator&lt;" and searchText "operator<", but that's not
		necessary for "Accessor" in our example above.

		Both the list of keywords and each keyword's list of members are already sorted into the order in which they should appear.


	Topic: Main Index File

		Information about which character combinations actually have results are stored in [Output Folder]\search\index.js.  The
		file contains a call to <NDSearch.OnIndexLoaded()> that looks like this:

		> NDSearch.OnIndexLoaded([ "a", "acc", "add", "ade", ... ]);

		The only parameter is an array of all the letter combinations that have files defined.  They are sorted so you can use a
		binary search to walk through them.
